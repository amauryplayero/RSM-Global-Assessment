Brewery finder makes an initial GET request to the OpenbreweryDB API to gather all NYC breweries. After that, once the user selects a brewery, another GET request is made to gather all the information necessary for the display of Details such as name, address, ZIP code, URL, and google map. The google map is displayed by using the React google maps library.
